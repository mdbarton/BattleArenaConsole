### BATTLE ARENA CODE TUTORIAL v3 ###

This project will actually be a three-in-one project but first things first.

This project will also introduce Source Control. You've presumably been looking at this via the gitHub version.

The first iteration of this projection is on the "Main branch" of the repository. For the second and third iterations we will create new "Branches" for those changes.



# LOOK AT THE CODE:

Ok, we've still got lots of udly code but here's some areas of improvement


Here's the basic flow, add breakpoints and "step-through" it (click the play button once paused) to watch for yourself.
 - upon start, code in the Program class will be executed, so line 8 instantiating "var g = new Game();" creates a new Game class (line 14)
 - the Game class has two "Private" fields for "Player" and "Opponent" both of the Combtant datatype
   * it's valuable to understand "g" is the specific instance of the Game class, we could have mulitple instances but methods, etc. only run on the specfic instance
 - The Start method waits for user to enter some text, we'll add more later but type "attack" and the attack method will be called for player (you)
